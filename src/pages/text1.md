### Here's a quick overview of five things you can do during your time in Curtorim, Salcete, Goa!

<ol>
    <li>St. Alex Church
        - <p>Located in the heart of Curtorim, St. Alex Church is the first thing you will see when you come to Goa. The backdrop of the church with the lake in front of it is quite lovely, and can make for a great spot to click some pictures. </p></li>

        Dhyanalaya Monastery
        <p>One of the most underrated spots in Curtorim, this is a catholic monastery started by a bunch of catholic nuns and missionaries from Spain. Located on the same hill as my residence in Curtorim, it arguably has one of the most stunning views in Curtorim due to its elevation. You can see the paddy fields at the centre of the village from the top of the hill, and forage some berries and fruits during your climb (if you choose to hike there.) </p>
